# Reboot Driver Game
## Project Description
After finishing the first project, all rebooters want to party.
  
Reboot Driver is a racing video game in which you become a fearful taxi driver who won't hesitate to risk his life to get you to your destination on time.
Overtake other vehicles and obstacles to reach the finish line before the timer reaches zero, and watch out, because crashing at that speed will be game over.

How many rebooters will you be able to take to the celebration?
## How to Play
Reach the target distance before time runs out.
Use **W** to accelerate. Use **A** to turn left. Use **D** to turn right. You will not be able to turn if you are standing still.
